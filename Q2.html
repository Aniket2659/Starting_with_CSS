<!-- In this HTML, we have four paragraphs, each with a unique class name. We've followed the BEM naming convention as follows: -->
<!-- 1. "paragraph" is the block or main container. -->
<!-- 2. paragraph--intro, paragraph--main, paragraph--sidebar, and paragraph--footer are element modifiers that describe the specific purpose or context of each paragraph. -->
